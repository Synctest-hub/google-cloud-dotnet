# This Dockerfile image expects to be run in the root directory of the
# google-cloud-dotnet repository. (It may also be run in other
# repositories with similar requirements, if they have an
# owl-bot-post-processor directory with a main.sh file.)

# The container is usually built automatically via Google Cloud Build,
# but you can also manually build with:
#   docker build -t gcr.io/cloud-devrel-public-resources/owlbot-dotnet .
# To launch a bash shell in the container, run:
#   docker run --rm -it --entrypoint bash gcr.io/cloud-devrel-public-resources/owlbot-dotnet:latest

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0.414-jammy

# Additional tooling required to regenerate libraries and project files.

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y unzip
RUN apt-get install -y python3

# Note: main.sh is not packed into the docker image.  This command
# invokes the current main.sh in the repo.
CMD ["./owl-bot-post-processor/main.sh"]
