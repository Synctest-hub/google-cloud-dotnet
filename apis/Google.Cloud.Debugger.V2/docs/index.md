The Google Cloud Debugger service is officially deprecated. See
the [deprecation page](https://cloud.google.com/debugger/docs/deprecations) and
[release notes](https://cloud.google.com/debugger/docs/release-notes)
for details.

The Google.Cloud.Debugger.V2 library is delisted from NuGet,
and the source code removed from the google-cloud-dotnet repository.
Any projects that depend on Google.Cloud.Debugger.V2 will still be
able to restore that dependency, but the package won't be shown in
search results on [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/).
