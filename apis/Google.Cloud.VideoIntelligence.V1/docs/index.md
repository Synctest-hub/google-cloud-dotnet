### Performing the initial request

Perform an initial call to `AnnotateVideo` or `AnnotateVideoAsync`.
This will return a [long-running operation](https://cloud.google.com/dotnet/docs/reference/help/long-running-operations),
which you can poll to check for completion and the results.

## Sample code

## Annotate labels within a video

{{sample:VideoIntelligenceServiceClient.AnnotateVideo}}

## Transcribe speech from a video
