The Storage v2 API is not currently supported for production use in
.NET. The code generated from the original protos and handwritten
code to support it should be considered experimental until this file
has been updated to indicate production readiness. We strongly
advise customers not to even experiment with this API until at least
a pre-release package has been published to NuGet. We will not
provide any support for usage before then.
