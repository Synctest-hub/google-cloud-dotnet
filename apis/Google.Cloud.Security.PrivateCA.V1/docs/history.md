- [Commit f09fdff](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-dotnet/commit/f09fdff): fix!: mark some bools as optional, correct response type of DeleteCaPool

This is a new major version as the change in response type for
`DeleteCaPool` is a breaking change. Customers using the 1.x libraries
are encouraged to upgrade, as attempting to obtain the result of the
operation created by the `DeleteCaPool` RPC will throw an exception
at execution time.
