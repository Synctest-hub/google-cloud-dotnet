The Google IoT Core service is officially deprecated, with a
retirement date of August 16th 2023. Contact your Google Cloud
account team for more information.

The Google.Cloud.IoT.V1 library is delisted from NuGet, and the
source code removed from the google-cloud-dotnet repository. Any
projects that depend on Google.Cloud.Debugger.V2 will still be able
to restore that dependency, but the package won't be shown in search
results on nuget.org.
