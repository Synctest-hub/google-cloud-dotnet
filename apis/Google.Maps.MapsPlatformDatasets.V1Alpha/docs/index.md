The Maps Platform Datasets v1alpha API is officially deprecated,
replaced by the v1 API.

The Google.Maps.MapsPlatformDatasets.V1Alpha package is delisted from NuGet,
and the source code removed from the google-cloud-dotnet repository.
Any projects that depend on the package will still be
able to restore that dependency, but the package won't be shown in
search results on [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/).

Please update your code to use Google.Maps.MapsPlatformDatasets.V1
instead.
