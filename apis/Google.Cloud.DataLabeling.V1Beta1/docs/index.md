The Data Labeling API is officially deprecated.

The Google.Cloud.DataLabeling.V1Beta package is delisted from NuGet,
and the source code removed from the google-cloud-dotnet repository.
Any projects that depend on the package will still be
able to restore that dependency, but the package won't be shown in
search results on [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/).
