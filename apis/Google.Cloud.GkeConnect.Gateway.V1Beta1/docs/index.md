The libraries for the [GKE Connect Gateway
API](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/enterprise/multicluster-management/gateway/using)
are now deprecated. Customers should use the Kubernetes client
library instead.

The Google.Cloud.GkeConnect.Gateway.V1Beta1 package is delisted from NuGet,
and the source code removed from the google-cloud-dotnet repository.
Any projects that depend on the package will still be
able to restore that dependency, but the package won't be shown in
search results on [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/).
